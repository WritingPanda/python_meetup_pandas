# Pandas Overview for the Python Meetup

This repo is to store code for the [Alamo City Python Group](http://www.meetup.com/Alamo-City-Python-Group/) in San Antonio, TX.

The code in this repo is meant to be shared with the attendees of the meetup to get a crash course into [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis. Also, it has a great name. We :heart: pandas.

This presentation is sponsored by [Def-Logix](http://def-logix.com), and the Alamo City Python Group meets at [Geekdom](http://geekdom.com), a co-working space in San Antonio.

Lots of cool stuff is happening, brah. Get with the times and the pandas. :panda_face: :panda_face: :panda_face:
